Planned next, in rough priority order:

- **Periodic KPI digest by email**: scheduled summary of a board's tiles and KPIs,
  computed with each recipient's own access rights.
- **Threshold alerts**: notify when an item's value crosses a configured limit.
- **Print-friendly board**: a print stylesheet that flattens the grid, plus a _Print_
  entry in the dashboard menu.

Under consideration, no commitment yet:

- **Cross filtering**: clicking a chart section filters the other items built on the
  same model.
- **Read-only public sharing**: token-based access to a board for people without an
  Odoo user. Needs a dedicated security review before it can be considered.
- **Value history**: optional snapshots of item values, to show trends and sparklines
  regardless of what the source model keeps.
- **Narrative board summary**: shipped in optional addon ``boardkit_dashboard_ai_agno``
  (Agno bridge + Summarize panel).
