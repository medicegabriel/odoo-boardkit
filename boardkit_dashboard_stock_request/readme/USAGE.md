Install this module (it auto-installs when Boardkit Dashboard and Stock Request
are both installed).

As a Dashboard Manager, open _All Dashboards > Boards_, click _From template_,
and choose **Stock Request Overview**. Optionally rename the board in the
wizard.

The board opens with the date filter on _This Month_. Open backlog tiles (Draft
Requests, In Progress, Overdue, Cancelled) ignore that filter so they always
show the current queue. Request volume and done metrics use _Expected Date_ and
follow the date filter. Quantities are only shown grouped by product, since each
request carries its own unit of measure and summing them together is
meaningless. Use the toggle filters (My Requests, In Progress, Done, Overdue) to
narrow the other cards.

When installed with demo data, a published board is created from this template
and placed first (sequence `-1`) under the related app menu.
